How to Use
Place a PNG image named mypic.png in the same folder as the script (or modify the script to use your image filename).

Run the script:

bash
Copy
Edit
python stego.py
When prompted:

Type E to encode (hide) a message, or D to decode (recover) a message.

Follow the prompts:

For encoding: enter your secret message and a password.

For decoding: enter the password used during encoding.

The script will create a new image file named hidden.png with the hidden message embedded.
